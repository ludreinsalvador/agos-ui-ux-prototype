## üìå Statement of the Problem  
- Growing concern in highly vulnerable regions affected by typhoons, such as rural areas in the Bicol Region, Eastern Visayas, Cagayan Valley, and parts of Northern and Central Luzon due to their geographic exposure along the Pacific Typhoon belt.  
- An average of 20 tropical cyclones enter the country each year, and 6 to 9 make landfall. These regions experience frequent flooding, landslides, and severe storm impacts.  

**Unequal Distribution of Technological Infrastructure**  
- Disparities persist due to centralized development favoring urban centers.

**High Exposure to Typhoons**  
- Areas like Bicol and Quezon are regularly within the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), making them highly vulnerable.

## üì± Scope of the App  
aGOs is a mobile application designed to help communities stay informed and safe during flood events. The app provides:  
- Real-time flood information  
- User reporting capabilities  
- Access to safety guidelines  

**Target Users:** Citizens and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs)

---

## ‚ùó Key Challenge  
Unreported civic issues such as potholes, flooding, and illegal dumping remain unresolved due to underreporting and uncoordinated response systems.

---

## üéØ Objectives  
1. Promote flood preparedness and awareness.  
2. Enable easy and accessible reporting with real-time location tracking.  
3. Encourage community engagement.  
4. Support informed decision-making.

## üß† Rationale  

aGOs addresses the critical need for timely flood alerts in rural, typhoon-prone areas in the Philippines. These communities often suffer from delayed or inaccessible government warnings. The mobile app offers a real-time alert system to help residents proactively reduce disaster impacts.  

While the initial focus is on the software component, future plans include hardware integration. The team intends to collaborate with Converge to develop a low-cost, IoT-based flood detection system, pending proposal approval. This hybrid approach balances immediate impact with long-term infrastructure goals.
