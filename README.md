## Statement of the Problem
- Growing concern of highly vulnerable regions affected by typhoons, such as rural areas in Bicol Region, Eastern Visayas, Cagayan Valley, and parts of Northern and Central Luzon are due to their geographic exposure along the Pacific Typhoon belt.
- An average of 20 tropical cyclones enter the country each year, and 6 to 9 make landfall. These regions experience frequent flooding, landslides, and severe storm impacts.
- **Unequal Distribution of Technological Infrastructure**
  - The disparity in technological infrastructure between urban and rural areas in the Philippines persists due to centralized development efforts favoring urban centers.
- **High Exposure to Typhoons Due to Geographic Location**
  - Regions such as Bicol and Quezon are frequently in the pathway of typhoons entering the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR), making them highly susceptible to severe weather events.

## Scope of the App
- Agos is a mobile application designed to help communities stay informed and safe during flood events. The app provides real-time information on flooding in their area, allows users to report local flood conditions, and access safety guidelines.
- **Target Users:** Citizens and Non-Government Units (NGOs)

---

## Key Challenge
- Unreported civic issues: Potholes, flooding, illegal dumping, and other local issues remain unresolved due to underreporting and uncoordinated response systems.

---

## Objectives
1. Promote Flood Preparedness and Awareness.
2. Easy and Accessible Reporting, with real-time location tracking.
3. Encourage Community Engagement.
4. Support Informed Decision-Making.

## Rationale

aGOs puts the notion to addressing the critical need for timely flood alerts in rural, typhoon-prone areas of the Philippines, where communities suffer from delayed or inaccessible government warnings. With the development of a user-friendly mobile app that delivers real-time alerts, the group aims to empower residents to take proactive measures to reduce the impact of natural disasters. Although our current focus is on implementing the software component, we also recognize the importance of hardware integration for a comprehensive and effective solution. Therefore, we express our strong intent to partner with Converge to develop a low-cost, IoT-based flood detection system if our proposal is ever approved. This approach allows us to demonstrate the immediate impact through the app while laying the groundwork for full system integration in the future.
